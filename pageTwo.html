		<h1>Python</h1>
		<p>
		  	Python is a high-level programming language that is becoming very popular because it is designed to emphasize code readability and to be structured a certain way. It is similar
			to Java in a lot of ways as it is also an object oriented language, however in python you do not need semicolons at the end of each line of code, though you can still 
			type them if you prefer. Python is being used for many different applications such as web development, game development, Data sciences, machine learning and AI, and so many more
			areas making it a very popular choice for programmers.
		</p>
		<h1>Django</h1>
		<p>
			Django is a high-level Python specific web framework that enhances and automatically takes care of a lot of the hassle when it comes to web development by coming with numerous 
			features and functions to help the developer such as Templates for most file types, Automated Admin site security through Django, and Django is quite scalable, meaning it is great
			for small applications and can be built to effectively handle and run massive ones that process much more data.
		</p>
		<h1>Working With Python and Django</h1>
		<p>
			Django brings robust tools that are useful for rapid web development with a clean design. When you start a Django project it builds your project's data model in python classes, 
			avoiding using SQL, just one of the many features that Django offers. If you are doing web development you should research Python and the Django framework and see if it would be 
			right for your applications because the tools and features are really helpful and make the overall experience of creating, testing, and designing a lot simpler.
